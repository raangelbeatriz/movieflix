# Movieflix

## ‚ú® About
The MovieFlix is a Flutter App, where the user can easily search for movies titles, see their synopsis, ranking, and release date. It also allows the user to see some popular titles and upcoming movies.
To make this happen I used a popular movie API called The Movie DB.

## ‚ö° Demo

## üéØ My Goal
My main goal was to make an app that fetches data from the web, so I could practice how to make HTTP requests, consume data from an API, with pagination, and display it. I also wanted to learn how to use Provider, and practice the MVVM architecture.

### ‚úèÔ∏è Refactor
After a while, I decided to refactor the project using a few concepts I've learned through the year such as:
- [X] Dependency Injection
- [X] Repository pattern
- [X] Inject View Models with Provider per demand
- [X] Debounce on search
- [X] Mixins

## üìñ What did I learned
- MVVM architecture
- Provider
- Pagination
- PageView Builder
- Future Builder

- Go to The Movie DB website, make an account and generate an API key
