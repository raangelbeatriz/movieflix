# Movieflix

The MovieFlix is a Flutter App, where the user can easily search for movies titles, see their synopsis, ranking, and release date. It also allows the user to see some popular titles and upcoming movies.
To make this happen I used a popular movie API called The Movie DB.

# My Goal
My main goal was to make an app that fetches data from the web, so I could practice how to make HTTP requests, consume data from an API, with pagination, and display it. I also wanted to learn how to use Provider, and practice the MVVM architecture.

# What did I learned
- MVVM architecture
- Provider
- How to make pagination in flutter
- PageView Builder
- Future Builder

# How to use
- Download the project in your machine
- Run `flutter pub get` in your project
- Go to The Movie DB website, make an account and generate an API key
- Go into the constant file, under the file folder, and paste your API key in the apiKey variable
- Run your project
